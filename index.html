                    I am an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) with nearly 4 years of experience in the field. 
                    Throughout my career, I have focused on automating web and mobile-based applications using Python, leveraging the power of the Pytest framework, Selenium WebDriver and Appium.
                    My passion for software development extends beyond testing, as I also thoroughly enjoy building websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
                    This combination of skills allows me to approach software testing with a developer's mindset, ensuring the highest level of quality and efficiency in every project I undertake. 
                    I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to innovative and impactful software solutions.
